            <h3>Benefits for EZ Notes for Andriod By Alexander Madani</h3>
              <p>
                Mobile Computing:
                Some natural questions one might ask about the Android Voice Based Note
                Taking App “EZ Notes,” might be: With so many other Note Taking Apps on the
                Market, what sets this App truly apart from all the others for smartphone users?
                And what are the common mobile computing Security Risks that EZ Notes helps
                address? What are the key benefits EZ Notes over other similar Note Taking
                Apps, and what “Pain Points” does this innovative solution resolve for mobile
                customers? In this Article, as the developer of EZ Notes and someone who holds
                a Computer Science degree with years of experience in effective User Interface
                design, I clarify some of these questions.
                              </p>
              <p>
                  To begin, it’s perhaps worth mentioning that I come from a background of
                almost a decade of using Smartphone Apps and Note Taking Organizers. I have
                used the popular mainstream organizing Apps like Google Keep and Evernote for
                a long time, prior to beginning my work on EZ Notes back in 2013. Before
                developing EZ Notes, I had also done extensive online research and study to see
                what sorts of “virtues” people claim they find most desirable in a great App. And I
                then try to take those into account when developing my Smartphone optimized
                Organizer called “EZ Notes.” My research revealed a consistent “pain point” for
                customers using other Organizers, which was that they wished their App was
                easier to use, and was more more efficient (less wasteful of their smartphone
                resources). These feedbacks from many customers actually dovetailed quite
                nicely with my own experiences having used the Mainstream Organizer Apps on
                my smartphone. Like many of the user comments that were confirming my own
                feelings, I saw that a large percentage of customers felt that their Apps were
                over-bloated, distracting, difficult to use, and actually a hindrance to their
                mobility and productivity. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  As a result of my research, I became very passionate about trying to write
                my own custom Note Taking Application entirely from Scratch, as an effort to help
                myself and other people address these types of issues, and many other important 
                modern day privacy and security demands. So I independently and naively (not
                knowing how challenging such an endeavor would be for one person to
                accomplish) decided to begin developing a solution I simply called “EZ Notes,” to
                capture my concept behind a truly enjoyable and intuitive “next-gen” organizer
                for android mobile devices. Of course not knowing much about Android Software
                development, I had a very steep challenge to climb, but I also felt strongly that
                sometimes the ground breaking innovations come from grass-roots development
                projects that are created outside of mainstream. Having a 20/20 hindsight
                experience using other Apps also benefited my perspective on how I expected my
                Software to behave and look like. Hence, in early 2013 I began the daunting
                challenge of researching, training, and rethinking everything from scratch. 
                      
              </p>
            <h3>The Resulting Product:</h3>
              <p>
                After almost 3 years of steady research, and countless days and nights
working on my passion, evolving, improving and optimizing my skills and
knowledge for developing “EZ Notes,” I am proud to say that we finally have a
very unique, capable, reliable and refreshingly user-friendly smartphone
application. Many outstanding Android Developers also became interested in my
App and my efforts, and helped to make EZ Notes as great as it has become.
Hence we won great awards from Technology sites around the world, and we
have one of the fastest growing most satisfied and friendly group of fans that I
personally could have never imagined would take interest in my passion for
mobility. These customers and fans are finding that EZ Notes has many hidden
Gems that help improve their lives every time they use EZ Notes.
So now, let us dive into the key factors why EZ Notes has grown so quickly
in popularity and become a successful independently developed smartphone App.
Firstly, EZ Notes is an App that loads incredibly fast, and has zero annoying
introductory Splash Screens, Log-ins, Sign-Ups, Cloud requirements, or
advertisements to bog down mobility or productivity! All of these sorts of
annoyances consume android resources and drain the battery, while frustrating
the user who needs to be on-the-go and done already. Mobility is especially
critical for Students, Medical Doctors, and others in the health care profession 
who are short on time and need tools that save time not waste it. But
interestingly, we are finding that EZ Notes is loved by everyone because it’s not
just Professionals that want to save time, but everyday folks as well. EZ Notes also
provides our world-wide customers with the advantage of working perfectly in
off-line mode (which is quite important to folks in countries where Broadband is
not readily available or is otherwise costly.) This means EZ Notes has minimal
requirements for Wi-Fi connectivity (only briefly when the user wishes to perform
their requested backup / transfer of notes using our EZ Backup feature which I
talk about a little later.) So part of the concept behind EZ Notes is that we want
to see our customers use Apps the way they were intended to be used (and
statistics indicate) by “Dipping-in” and “Dipping-out” of their tasks as effortlessly
as possible. Survey studies by Google and others reveal that on average, a user
utilizes a given App for a few minutes a day expects a Fast and easy experience. 
              </p>
              <p>
                With EZ Notes, as soon as the user taps on our “Birdie” launcher icon from
their home screen, they are instantly presented with a Beautiful, Clean and
Inviting Home Screen with intuitive functions right within reach. Our App is
deliberately kept clean and simple as possible, to put users immediately in charge
and provide them access to critical functions right with the reach of their
fingertips. This is partly because my experience with Android Apps showed that
very few Apps on the market do an adequate job of keeping things simple, and
focusing on placing everything within Comfortable Easy reach of their users. So
with EZ Notes, that’s been addressed perfectly. We don’t hide and embed the
most commonly used daily tasks, which would make them difficult to find or
reach and hence frustrate and slow down customers. Additionally, our new users
are delighted to discover that with “EZ Notes,” our greatest and most valuable
feature (missing from many Note Taking Apps) is in our very unique and amazing
Voice Transcription features which have won critical acclaim for being so handy
(both by Technology Sites as well as customer feedback). For example, simply by
tapping a single Microphone icon on the home screen (available also inside the EZ
Editor), the user instantly (and while on-the-go) invokes their Speech Recognizer
and begins speaking one or multiple sentences without any hindrance. Our
customers are amazed by how their Notes (Cards) pop-up automatically and save 
instantly before their eyes, without any further interaction required. We called
this our “Ultimate Mobility” (Hands-Free) Edge for our dear customers. Hence,
the key differentiator that really sets EZ Notes apart and gives our users a huge
edge is a very clever twist (innovation) that I managed to develop for our Android
ListView adapater technologies. This single breakthrough feature which is so
important for mobility, took me 8-9 months of intense experimental labor with
Google’s Voice Transcription (Speech-to-Text) Java engine, and my own creativity
and patience to have the Voice Notes “pop-up” instantly and get time-stamped
and saved without the use of our Editor. With my Approach, we place mobility at
the helm of priorities for you, and spare you the hassle of clicking, typing and
editing for a time of your convenience. It’s perhaps the first time an App has
worked harmoniously toe-to-toe with the demands of our highly mobile active
lifestyles.
As a result of our outstanding Voice Transcription and single tap EZ to reach
user interfaces, EZ Notes has quickly became known to thousands of European,
Asian, and Americans customers, who have shared the App with their friends, coworkers,
and relatives to help them benefit also. Clearly my concept of Lightning
Fast Ultimate Mobility has resonated with smartphone enthusiasts. They also
greatly appreciate our Stock, Snappy, and High Efficiency for their precious
investments. So as some simple examples of how our “Hands-Free” voice
recognition features are helping so many people, you can imagine a user who may
be in a rush to get shopping done as fast and effortlessly as possible, and needs a
Paperless Tool that listens and rapidly records their fast Shopping Items
(completely “Hands-Free” without any physical interaction required); few if any
apps can do so as effortlessly as EZ Notes. Then when inside the Store and the
person is picking up their shopping items, they instantly “Swipe” the Card (Note)
away from their screen and address the next reminder.
As a more important and concrete example scenario of how Professionals
are using EZ Notes, you can imagine a busy doctor or nurse working in a hospital
or other health care facility who needs a very fast and EZ organizer to accomplish
tasks and duties. Such professionals often need to quickly take down a few critical
sentences as a (reminder) to them later. The key here is that they want to be able 
to speak their Notes “Hands-Free” as quickly as possible while their thoughts are
still fresh in his / her mind (perhaps right after attending a patient). Furthermore,
this Doctor / Nurse has many other tasks and patients to serve (has a busy
schedule and can’t afford a lot of “Monkeying around” with their app struggling to
get things done). Hence what’s needed is a highly Mobile and as “Hands-Free”
solution, that can easily keep pace with these challenging mobile demands. For
these and many other scenarios (which other Apps were not optimized for), EZ
Notes is absolutely the perfect solution. EZ Notes is extremely Non-bloated, uses
very high automation and inviting interfaces, and focuses the user on their task
better than any other Mobile solution. Indeed, such potential application
scenarios of EZ Notes (for Students, Lab Technicians, and everyday mobile users)
are just the tip of the ice-berg. EZ Notes is one of the few Organizers that uses the
simplest and most easy to use interfaces on the market. EZ Notes aims to
minimize user stress and guess work associated with daily tasks and errands. At
EZ Notes, we are indeed light years ahead in our ability to intuitively fuse and
melt together Spoken and Typed Text, in an instant, convenient and
indistinguishable fashion!

              <h4>EZ Sketch Empowers Creativity:</h4>
              <p>
                In addition to its Lightning Fast Note Taking and Organizing features, EZ
Notes also includes a brilliant drawing and Freehand sketching Application. This
fantastic feature referred to as EZ Sketch, enables Artists, Illustrators, and
Children with developing minds, to utilize the conveniences and awesome
benefits of digital art including: Colorful Drawings, Detailed Sketches, illustration
of ideas and concepts, Sharing Meeting Notes, Homework problems sketched by
hand and more. The user can also easily Save & Load their color sketches from
their Android Storage (media gallery) for further processing & sharing by
Facebook and Email. EZ Sketch has become an indispensable tool with wide
ranging capabilities applicability for: Business, School, Students sharing and
solving Assignment problems, and the creation of Sketches and other Instructive
Diagrams to convey concepts visually. Our canvas offers many awesome features
including: Several preset Brush Sizes (with ability to customize thickness), canvas
pressure sensitivity, several fill patterns for highlighting and color blending 
effects, saving sketches to and loading from disk, sharing via Facebook & Email,
along with a great selection of colors to draw most anything you desire.
If the aforementioned features of our Canvas were not impressive enough,
there’s lots more: The ability to instantly fill the background color of your canvas,
the ability to instantly clear the entire canvas (for quickly starting over), the ability
to undo up to the last 10 drawing strokes, the ability to move your Art to a
particular canvas location for adding more details, as well as the ability to enter
full screen mode (removing the surrounding user interface buttons that might be
distracting or limiting your View of the project. Clearly with so many capabilities,
it's easy to see why EZ Sketch is such an indispensable tool within EZ Notes. 
              </p>
              <h5>Device Efficiency is another one of the Top Benefits of “EZ Notes:”</h5>
              <p>
                In the final section of this Article, I’d like to quickly point out some
important benefits of EZ Notes, when it comes to Device Efficiency and Security of
Data. With EZ Notes, we are one of the few Apps that have been redesigned from
the ground up, to also address Android Resource Efficiency (CPU, RAM, Battery
and Storage Space). For modern Android Smartphone enthusiasts, their
investment is not only fairly expensive, but also very precious to them, and they
want to take the best care of their hardware and its resources. By extension of
the fact that my Fans and customers tend to be huge fans of Slim, Stock and
Snappy solutions (like myself -- a Nexus 6 user), they also prefer Apps that are not
only extremely responsive, but also responsible on their device! By responsible
of course I mean in how their App (software) utilizes Hardware Resources and
Permissions. Firstly of all, our App has an incredibly Google Play Store package
size of under 3.5 MB (according to Google Play and as of the time of this article).
So we are extremely slim given how much we offer. Furthermore, EZ Notes stores
most all of the Notes (with the exception of color canvas sketches) as Plain Text.
This means that EZ Notes will not generate large wasteful Audio Clip Files when
you speak Notes. And it does not rely on heavy use of Photo capture, or other
image processing to waste resources on your smartphone like other Apps. A big
part of my aim and goal with EZ Notes was to move away from (and hence offer
people an alternative) to how Apps from Giant Corporations tend to do: Which is 
storing large Audio Clip files, Photo Capture, and Synchronization of Notes from
multiple devices down to a smartphone. As seemingly convenient as
Synchronization may appear, it also places quite a bit of Strain on smartphone
resources. With EZ Notes, by not trying to be all things, to all people, across all
devices, we deliver a much faster more focused and productive organizer that is
about the essentials. Our customers also appreciate how my design organizes
each task and their Notes into separate clean “Areas” (and folders) to help
eliminate the traditional “claustrophobic” feeling of other organizers. Bear in
mind that EZ Notes was developed AFTER many other Apps, including the giants
like Evernote and Google Keep. So I suppose we had the analytical advantage of
knowing studying what features are the most important to people (that they love
and use the most), and which ones less critical or even undesired. For example,
one feature that I have deliberately refused to include into EZ Notes is something
called online storage and Synchronization (referred to simply as Syncing). As we
get into this a bit later, suffice it to say that Syncing “sucks up” all the notes from
various platforms and devices, stores them on a Server on the Cloud (like for
example Google Drive)… and then re-downloads them to a device.
At EZ Notes, I observed a quite a few things less desirable aspects to this
seemingly “Convenient” Syncing feature that has been embellished by the Giants
as a great way to do their “Data Mining” (data collection) operations. Therefore
in line with my theme for this App as an alternative safer and more convenient
solution, I decided to work around (avoid) using Syncing (and come up with
something different and safer). Here are a few very important reasons we don’t
use Syncing in EZ Notes: (1) Synced Notes are always sitting there stored on the
Cloud, and eventually become Prey for Hackers. This becomes increasingly risky as
a popular App gains more and more customers like EZ Notes is doing. For
example, In 2013, 50 million Evernote customers who were paying around $5
dollars or so a month for their App’s “Premium Syncing” feature, had their
sensitive Private information Breached (stolen) by Hackers. Understandably, these
customers became very irate at Evernote and realized that their so called
“Premium” Syncing plan was not so Premium after all! At EZ Notes, we want to
make a big effort to minimize the chances of such catastrophes for our customer’s 
sensitive data. That’s why I do not believe in collecting (data mining) customer
data and making them exposed and vulnerable to Hackers. So EZ Notes does not
collect (“suck up”) our customer’s data to the cloud by permanently storing them
on Servers (like those offered by the giant corporations: Google, Microsoft,
Yahoo, Apple, etc…). No one can truly estimate how much money is lost to these
Hacking catastrophes that are becoming worse and worse over time. Every time
we hear of a Hacking event, the numbers are many times larger than the prior
ones. Ironically, at the time of writing this article in Early May 2016, once again a
report has come out that a Russian Hacker has breached the Emails (customer
data) of well over 271 million world-wide customers whose data was stored on
the servers of Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, and many others. This is over 5 times as
catastrophic as the one experienced by Evernote in 2013. Learn more from this
Yahoo report -> http://finance.yahoo.com/video/garry-kasparov-russian-hackers-165753376.html
(2) Syncing Wastes a Lot of Android Resources. Working silently as a background
service, Syncing puts strain on the CPU, RAM, and Battery of Android devices,
while also reducing the longevity of your Charge on the device. With EZ Notes,
we feel that there are enough Apps using such “Reckless” hidden background
services that strain and slow down Android, that I don’t want my software EZ
Notes to be a negative contributor to that mess. Hence, for backup or transfer of
Notes, we instead offer an “EZ Export” function which utilizes your trusted ISP
servers that you currently use for your email and web services. This way we try to
help eliminate or at least greatly reduce overexposure of your Notes data on
multiple different servers. (3) Perhaps some final reasons not to embellish
Syncing, is that it requires access to data networks (Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE etc.) Perhaps in
the United States and Europe this may not be an issue, but for people in the rest
of the world it can be an issue because it can add surcharges to the user’s Data
Account (or they simply may not have readily available access to broadband
networks). So we wanted our users to have more control over how and whether
to utilize their Wi-Fi and data services or not. Our Approach also offers another
advantage in that it allows our customer to easily make some last minute changes
to some of the notes being transferred from their smartphone to say a PC or
Tablet device. By using our EZ Export function, all of the Notes are placed inside
your preferred email program (editor) in a easy to see and review Report fashion. 
From here, users can control which Notes they wish to backup, which ones are
outdated or simply not important. The user can also even introduce last minute
emergency changes. For example, suppose you had a Note about a meeting that
is to occur with your friends at a certain time and place, but circumstance for the
meeting have changed and you need to modify the time or location (or both).
With our Approach using EZ Export, you can easily make such last minute changes
before you backup your notes or transfer them to your colleagues as a reminder
by email. Hence, EZ Notes makes it easy to Email individual notes, or entire
batches of Notes (as an easy Email Report), to give you more control and
awareness. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, we can see that EZ Notes has taken years of dedicated
research, and engineering work to reimagine how things can be made simpler. I
have addressed unnecessary and dangerous features which expose user data to
online Hacking. I have also retuned traditional tasks and features from other
Organizers, to make ours much more automated and required the least
frustration and distraction (the digging and clicking steps unsuitable for a
smartphone and our dear customers). It’s also worth mentioning that due to my
own personal philosophy about safe and efficient computing, EZ Notes is not only
the fastest most efficient Organizer of its kind, but it the most non-intrusive App
(requiring only a single READ/WRITE permission in order process your colored
sketches from the medial gallery.) In fact, I am proud to report that our App
receives the best safety score Privacy and Security (according to the well-known
App by John MacAfee called “DCentral 1” (available on Google Play from his
company called “Future Tense Secure Systems, Inc.”) Hence, we are delighted to
inform everyone that EZ Notes is not only the most convenient and suitable
smartphone App, but it also receives the best safety score which is much more
favorable compared to Mainstream solutions. EZ Notes doesn’t do any of the
risky activities the other Apps and Services do, such as: Tracking your location
using your GPS sensor, Collect your list of Contacts, Collecting your search terms
on search engines, Tracking your other installed apps etc. EZ Notes believes that
your activities are completely your own and should remain as anonymous and
secure as possible.
